# FOAM Lite Repo

The Real World Example has been implemented as a set of Solidity smart contracts, and powered by FOAM’s PureScript Web3 tooling, deployed with [Chanterelle](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/chanterelle/). The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/foam.lite/) contains the smart contracts, and various utilities written in PureScript to aid you in interacting with the smart contracts and exploring the FOAM Lite approach. A quickstart example is available in the README. We hope it serves as a useful reference to show you how the concepts demonstrated here come together to enable an Ethereum-of-Things application.

## System Requirements

- Either an x86/64 Linux OS, or an Intel or M1-based Mac
    - The build hasn’t been tested on Windows, let us know if it works for you!
    - The PureScript compiler and Spago package manager unfortunately do not have precompiled binaries for all ARM distributions, and as such NPM has trouble executing our build scripts on these platforms
- GNU Make
- Bash shell
- Node.js ≥ v10.
    - We recommend using [NVM](https://nvm.sh). Various libraries in the PureScript ecosystem occasionally have trouble keeping up with newest versions of Node, so we would recommend that use the `lts/dubnium` release.
- Docker
    - This is to allow the quickstart example to spin up an ephemeral blockchain with our [Cliquebait](https://hub.docker.com/r/foamspace/cliquebait) image for development purposes.

## Components and Configuration

Most of the software components can be configured with environment variables outlined here.

### FOAM Lite Explorer

A Purescript frontend showing RelayableNFT minting and transfer events queried from the blockchain. It serves as a demo of the kind of applications that are possible with the purescript-web3 libraries and tooling.

### Helper Scripts

A command line utility is built as part of `make bundle` and resides in `dist/helper.js`. Running `node dist/helper.js` will show all of the available options and flags, all of which are thoroughly documented in the script and most subcommands have a `--help` option that can be passed in. These serve to allow you to perform the specific steps needed to replicate the setup outlined in the Real World example.

### Relayer Emulation Server

A basic REST API server is build as part of `make bundle` and resides in `dist/server.js`. It is used in the quickstart to allow one to simulate the radio broadcast between a relayer and end node. Encoded messages can be submitted to the `/relay/validate` and `/relay/submit` endpoint.

Environment variables include:

- `NODE_URL`: The URL of the Ethereum node to use for blockchain interactions. This defaults to `http://localhost:8545`, which is convenient when running a local node or Cliquebait
- `FUNGIBLETOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the ERC20 token used for transaction fees. If not specified,  will attempt to read it from the Chanterelle deployment artifacts.
    - An alternative path to the deployment artifact can be specified with `FUNGIBLETOKEN_ARTIFACT`
- `RELAYABLENFT_ADDRESS`: The address of the RelayableNFT contract to interact with. If not specified, will attempt to read it from the Chanterelle deployment artifacts
    - An alternative path to the deployment artifact can be specified with  `RELAYABLENFT_ARTIFACT`
- `RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY`: If the Ethereum node specified in `NODE_URL` does not have any unlocked accounts, you can specify the private key of the relayer account to submit relayed transactions with.
- `SERVER_HOST`: The address to listen for connections on
- `SERVER_PORT`: The port to listen for connections on

### LoRa Packet Forwarder

There is a small server meant to interface with the LoRa packet forwarder present in most off-the-shelf gateways built with `make bundle` and resides in `dist/lora.js`. This allows one to use real LoRa hardware to relay FOAM Lite messages to the blockchain. While more detailed documentation is coming soon, you can read a quickstart in `PI.md`.

Environment variables include:

- `NODE_URL`: The URL of the Ethereum node to use for blockchain interactions. This defaults to `http://localhost:8545`, which is convenient when running a local node or Cliquebait
- `FUNGIBLETOKEN_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the ERC20 token used for transaction fees. If not specified,  will attempt to read it from the Chanterelle deployment artifacts.
    - An alternative path to the deployment artifact can be specified with `FUNGIBLETOKEN_ARTIFACT`
- `RELAYABLENFT_ADDRESS`: The address of the RelayableNFT contract to interact with. If not specified, will attempt to read it from the Chanterelle deployment artifacts
    - An alternative path to the deployment artifact can be specified with  `RELAYABLENFT_ARTIFACT`
- `RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY`: If the Ethereum node specified in `NODE_URL` does not have any unlocked accounts, you can specify the private key of the relayer account to submit relayed transactions with.
- `PACKET_FORWARDER_HOST`: The address to listen for connections from the LoRa gateway driver on.
- `PACKET_FORWARDER_PORT`: The address to listen for connections from the LoRa gateway driver on.
